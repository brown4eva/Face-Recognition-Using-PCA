# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA

## This project was mainly focused on designing a simple facial recognition system using a very  dataset of training images acquired from my collagues in class. The project was mainly divided into two parts. First part was about normalization of the training set and the second part was about incorporating principal component analysis with the facial recognition system.

## Principal component Analysis can be used for many purposes we found some of them are to decrease the computational complexity and measure of the covariance between the images. PCA reduces the complexity of computation when there is large number of database of images. These principal components of the Eigen vector of this covariance matrix when concatenated and converted gives the Eigen faces. These Eigen faces are the ghostly faces of the trained set of faces form a face space. This distance gives the location of the image in the Eigen space, which is taken as the output matched image.
